## Naming standards
1. Avoid using mixed case while creating database objects i.e table, column, stored procedure, etc  

## Features
1. Standard time travel is 7 days. If exception is needed, please work with DBAs 
2. If you are planning to load PII data elements, please let DBAs know so appropriate roles can be setup with data masking 
3. To manage slowly changing dimensions or date chaining, use streams on the database. It will be very efficient and better way to identify what changed.   
## Performance
1. **Snowflake is a ANSI SQL compliant relational database platform and data modeling is very important. For analytic use cases, either Star schema or Snowflake schema normalized structure is preferred** Please remember the following while creating structures on Snowflake or any relational database 
   * All columns that have metrics should be numeric so data can be summarized. 
   * While snowflake does not enforce referential integrity, it is a best practice to add primary key and foreign key on the table. 
         Primary key uniquely identifies each row on the table
         Foreign key links the table to other table. 
   * Antipattern - Not a good practice to create table with Sparse data in columns. For example, having a table with 500 columns and depending on values in one column, we decide which columns have data. This type of "unnormalized" data will be NON performant  
   * Antipattern - Don't use case statement or scalar functions in join conditions
   * **Data Modelling is important** -  [Example Datamodel]![](https://github.nwie.net/Nationwide/snowflake/blob/master/DataModel.JPG)
2. It is recommended that tables have cluster key defined which will be used for data pruning. Candidate columns are generally dates.  
3. It is recommended that we don’t have NULLs in the data. Please provide default values instead, so joins are efficient.  
4. When loading the data, please have files that are 10-100MB in size. Compress the data before loading if possible.
5. Processing 
   a) Before you run delete, run a select statement to confirm how many rows will be impacted. Change ‘delete from’ to select star from
   b) To check data in the table as of previous day, run the following sql. 

6. Data type 
Snowflake also has introduced a VARIANT data type for semi-structured data storage (AVRO, JSON, XML, Parquet, and others).

7. Replication 
Store external tables in separate schema. Data replication for DR/HA doesn't support external tables
